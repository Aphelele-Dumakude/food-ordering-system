Learn Spring boot microservices with Clean & Hexagonal architectures, DDD, SAGA, Outbox, CQRS, Kafka, Kubernetes & GKE

In this project, we focus on architectural aspects of microservices architecture and use Clean Architecture principles while developing each service. In the implementation of the domain layer, we also apply Domain Driven Design principles. We also learn and use Apache Kafka as the event store, and use events to communicate between services, and to implement the architectural patterns.

The key concepts that we have learned and implemented in this project are as follows:

- Develop Microservices Architecture using Spring Boot and Kafka
- Understand and Apply Clean Architecture
- Understand and Apply Hexagonal Architecture
- Understand and Apply Domain Driven Design(DDD)
- Implement SAGA Architecture Pattern
- Implement Outbox Architecture Pattern
- Implement CQRS Architecture Pattern
- Learn Kafka Architecture and Programming on Kafka
- Learn using Kafka as the Event Store for Event-Driven Services
- Learn Kubernetes basics & Run a local cluster using Docker desktop
- Deploy microservices to local Kubernetes Cluster
- Run Confluent Kafka on Kubernetes using cp-helm-charts
- Run Postgres on Kubernetes
- Learn Google Cloud and Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE)
- Deploy microservices to Google Kubernetes Engine
